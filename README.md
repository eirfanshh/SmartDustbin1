# SmartDustbin1

##  Project Overview
SmartDustbin1 is an automated dustbin system built using an Arduino UNO, designed to improve hygiene and convenience. The system uses **two ultrasonic sensors** to detect:

- When a hand or object approaches to automatically open and close the lid.
- When the dustbin is full, triggering a notification through an LED indicator and a message on the Serial Monitor.

This smart system provides a touchless waste disposal experience and alerts users when the dustbin requires emptying.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

- **Sensor 1 (Hand Detection)**:  
  Detects an approaching object within **30 cm**. When triggered:
  - The servo motor opens the lid.
  - After **8 seconds**, the lid closes automatically.

- **Sensor 2 (Bin Full Detection)**:  
  Detects the distance from the top of the bin to the trash surface. If the distance is less than **10 cm**:
  - A **White LED** turns on.
  - The message **"FULL"** is displayed on the **Arduino Serial Monitor**.

- **Standby Red LED**:  
  Blinks slowly to indicate the system is active.

##  Future Improvements

- Integrate a Bluetooth module (HC-05) or Wi-Fi (ESP32) for mobile app notifications.
- Add an OLED display to show real-time bin status.
- Connect to Arduino IoT Cloud for remote monitoring (with Wi-Fi board).
